# Overview

I do not own the rights to the images used in this project, however in no way is this site to be used for monetary purposes.

This project is a javascript memory game. The objective of the site is to demonstrate my understanding of javascript. The site is built with HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and has access to the EmailJS service.

The game is designed to test peoples memory, and is fully interactive.

I chose Pokemon for the theme due to its place in popular culture, its ability to improve the game like feel and its enhanced ability to trend.

The core code is not my own, and was taken from an article. A link to the article can be found at the bottom of this file. The code has been refactored and features added / removed to suit my requirements. The theme was also changed.

# Design

### Color scheme

![image of my colour choices](assets/images/colour_palettes.png)

Background image was taken from loading.io (https://loading.io/) and used the chosen (above) colour scheme. With a budget, i would have animated the background so the lighter grandient moved around the page to improve the UX and game feel.

### Typography

All fonts were taken from Google font (https://fonts.google.com/).

- Body/Main Font - Inter

I chose this font for its readability at all sizes and at different case sensitivity.

- Header/Feature text Font - Zen Dot
- Body - Inter

I chose Xen Dot font to maximise UX and suit the game genre. Inter was chosen for its readabilty and clean design.

### Sizing

I chose REM as the primary unit metric due to its flexability with responsive design. I have also used PX with some containers for absolute sizing.

### Imagery

### Design rationale - strategy, scope, structure, skeleton, surface

The game was designed to help users improve decision making and improve memory and focus.

I used a simple flexable design that made sure all major functionality and calls to action were immediatly present, making the site easier to use and understand.

I implemented validation in the form of name input so that the timer was not immediatly started, before the user could learn how to play. This removed friction and reduced frustration for users.

I decided to have the scoring table present, under the game board so that it was immediatly present after a user had completed a round, and moved with the flow of ones eye and the flow/direction of the site.

The colour scheme and background were chosen to improve the asthetics of the game, match the theme and be easy on the eye.
