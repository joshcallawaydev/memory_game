# Overview

I do not own the rights to the images used in this project, however in no way is this site to be used for monetary purposes.

This project is a javascript memory game. The objective of the site is to demonstrate my understanding of javascript. The site is built with HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and has access to the EmailJS service.

The game is designed to test peoples memory, and is fully interactive.

The framework is not my own, and was taken from an article. A link to the article can be found at the bottom of this file. The code has been refactored and features added / removed to suit my requirements.

> Color scheme

![image of my colour choices](assets/images/colour_palettes.png)

> Typography

All fonts were taken from Google font (https://fonts.google.com/).

- Body/Main Font - Inter

I chose this font for its readability at all sizes and at different case sensitivity.

- Header Font - Zen Dot

I chose this font to maximise UX and suit the game genre.

> Sizing

I chose REM as the primary unit metric due to its flexability with responsive design. I have also used PX with some containers for absolute sizing.

> Imagery
