# User stories

The site works seamlessly across all viewport sizes but was built mobile first.

The image below does not represent the phone size at which the site was designed at. Just a representation that mobile first was the direction.

In effort to improve UX/UI i regularly tested the site functionality and responsiveness. This way I could see UX/UI issues first hand and deploy changes in accordance with our principles. I also drafted in friends to attempt to break the site's viewing experience and functionality.

### UX Testing

1. First time - as a first time user i would like to

- play the game
- easily navigate the site
- understand how the game is played

2. Returning - as a returning user i would like to

- see my scores
- see my click rate
- play the game within 3 clicks (excluding any validation needed)

3. Frequent 

- see social media links
- contact the creator
